            I'm Wollay, the creator of Cube World. I started this game in June 2011. My inspirations were Minecraft, Zelda, Secret of Mana, Monster Hunter, Diablo, World of Warcraft and many more.
            My aim was to create an infinite, colorful, procedurally generated world, full of adventures, monsters, and mysteries. The result is <i>Cube World</i>, a voxel-based role-playing game.
        </p>
        <p>
            My wife joined development in 2012, and we have released the <i>alpha version</i> for Windows PC in July 2013. The alpha already has many features, but some are still missing. You can check out a feature overview below.
        </p>

        <p>
            The alpha is available for a lower price than the beta version and the final version.
            We're planning to release updates regularly. Updates are free.

<img src="https://d1bcl7tdsf48aa.cloudfront.net/images/cubeworld/features/worlds.jpg">
<div class="page">
    <h2>Infinite Worlds</h2>
    <p>
        A main feature of Cube World is the random world generation. In contrast to many games, worlds are not designed by a level designer, but generated procedurally by the game using math and random numbers.
        The result is an endless world (nearly endless, i.e. players can't reach the borders), so players can explore new landscapes all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Players can generate their own worlds by specifiying one single number, the <i>seed</i>. The same seeds result in exactly the same world, so players can share their worlds with friends by telling them their seeds.
    </p>
    <p>
        Worlds are generated on-the-fly while playing, so there are neither long precomputations nor huge save files at the beginning.
    </p>
    <h2>No borders</h2>
    <p>
        There are no artificial borders. You can literally reach each cube the world is made of. If you see a mountain on the horizon, you can climb that mountain. If you see a tree, you can climb on top of the tree.
        At least if your climbing skill is good enough. :)
    </p>
    <h2>Landscapes</h2>
    <p>
        Cube World consists of different lands with varying climates and themes. There are grasslands, snowy landscapes, wide oceans, dangerous lava lands, jungles, and deserts.
        Landscapes are full of mountains, caves, rivers, lakes, forests, rocks, dungeons, castles, ruins, catacombs, temples, villages, and more.

<div class="page">
    <h2>Adventure Skills</h2>
    <p>
        Being an exploration RPG, an important focus of Cube World is exploration and adventure. In Cube World, players are equipped with a set of skills that a true adventurer needs:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Climbing</b> allows players to ascend the highest rocks and reach the deepest abyss.</li>
            <li><b>Swimming</b> through rivers, lakes and oceans is routine for a Cube World adventurer.</li>
            <li><b>Diving</b> to the ground of a lake or exploring underwater caves is also possible.</li>
            <li><b>Hang gliding</b> from a mountain right into a lush valley is a common task in Cube World.</li>
            <li><b>Sailing</b> enables ocean explorers to travel quickly from one island to another.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Dungeons</h2>
    <p>
        Dungeons are dangerous places full of rare loot and are integrated seemlessly into the world. Dungeon enemies are often stronger than normal enemies and there are dungeon bosses.
        Dungeons occur in different forms, such as castles, ruins, temples, pyramids, and catacombs. Apart from that, there are overworld dungeons, which are less structured and consist of disconnected
        buildings.
    </p>
    <h2>Missions</h2>
    <p>
        Every Cube World day, new missions are available. Missions send players to dungeons or huge boss monsters. Completing a mission gives valuable rewards like weapons, armor and <i>platinum coins</i>.
        <i>Platinum coins</i> can be used to upgrade weapons and armor.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a player likes a land he can basically stay forever in that land and just do daily missions.

    <h2>Classes</h2>
    <p>
        There are currently four playable classes in Cube World: Warriors, Rangers, Mages, and Rogues.

    </p>
    <p>
        We wanted to give each class a different gameplay and feel.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The key feature of <b>warrior</b> gameplay is <i>charged attacks</i>: they can build up MP with normal attacks and charge up powerful special attacks.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Rangers</b> use <i>ranged charged attacks</i>, which work similar like warrior attacks, but using ranged weapons.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Mages</b> cast spells with varying cast times. Normal attacks are usually faster, while special attacks have longer cast times and consume MP.

            <b>Rogue</b> gameplay is fast-paced and special attacks are instant. That way they can concentrate on evasion and move freely during combat.

    <h2>Specializations</h2>
    <p>
        In order to allow for more diversified gameplay, we added <i>class specializations</i>. Each class can choose one out of two specializations, which changes playstyle and abilities of that class.
    </p>
    <p><b>Warrior specializations:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Berserker: Attack speed is increased with each hit. Can charge attacks more quickly.</li>
        <li>Guardian: Can block attacks with all weapons and has increased health. Can become immune against stun attacks.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Ranger specializations:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sniper: Has camouflage and aim abilities. Attack speed is increased with each hit.</li>
        <li>Scout: Special attacks have a chance to become instantly chargeable. Can sprint.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Mage specializations:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fire: Special attacks have a chance to become instantly chargeable. Can cast fire explosions. </li>
        <li>Water: Attack speed is increased with each hit. Has healing spells.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Rogue specializations:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Assassin: Special attacks increase stealth. Has improved stealth abilities. </li>
        <li>Ninja: Dodges during special attacks. Can throw shurikens.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Skill trees</h2>
        <p>
            With each gained level, players can assign skill points to a skill tree. There are class specific skills like attacks or spells, and common skills like climbing, hang gliding, or pet riding.
        </p>

        <h2>Infinite Progression</h2>
        <p>
            Not only worlds are infinite, but so are you character's progression. This means players can theoretically level up infinitely and put infinitely many skill points into their skill trees.
            However, this doesn't mean that players can become infinitely <b>powerful</b>. The <b>power</b> of players, creatures, items and skills doesn't scale linearly or exponentially with the <b>level</b>,
            but it scales <i>tangentially</i>. So while <b>levels</b> can be between 1 and infinity, the corresponding <b>power</b> is between 1 and 100. A power of 100 can only be reached with an infinite level.
            In lower levels, power increments are more notable than in higher levels.
        </p>
        <p>
            This system has two advantages: First, there's no level cap and the player never has the feeling of having reached the end of the game.
            Second, power cannot be infinite. For each land, the game generates creatures and dungeons evenly in all power ranges (1-100).
            That way the player can freely travel from land to land and can always be sure to find creatures and dungeons of his power.
        </p>

<div class="twothird">
    <div class="page">
        <p>
            Combat in Cube World is based on player skill, movement and reaction. Skilled players can beat high-level monsters, while not-so-skilled players can be beaten by low-level creatures.
        </p>
        <h2>Manual Aiming</h2>
        <p>
            Enemies need to be targeted manually with a crosshair. There's no target locking. Good players will land more hits and thus deal more damage.
        </p>
        <h2>Active Dodging</h2>
        <p>
            Most attacks can be dodged with good reaction and proper timing. Dodging costs stamina and makes you immune against damage for a very short time. With skill and good stamina management,
            you can survive even the strongest attacks.
        </p>
        <h2>Combos</h2>
        <p>
            All creatures have <i>armor</i> and <i>resistance</i>. Armor decreases physical damage, resistance magical damage. Every time you hit an opponent, you get a combo point.
            The more combo points you have, the more armor/resistance of your enemy is ignored for your attacks. So if you succeed to build up enough combo points, you can penetrate even the heaviest armor.

            Cube World is full of monsters: there are slimes, zombies, ogres, skeletons, vampires, werewolves, and many more.
        </p>
        <h2>Boss Monsters</h2>
        <p>
            Boss monsters are the strongest creatures in Cube World. Some of them are humanoid, like trolls with big wooden clubs or one-eyed cyclopses. Others are undead, like the evil liches, that summon
            zombies and skeletons. There are saurians which are armored with scales and armed with sharp horns and teeth.
        </p>
        Defeating a boss monster requires a lot of skill and experience. Players have to study their attacks and react properly. They have to jump during earthquakes by trolls, they have to stay away from cyclone attacks by cyclopses,
        and have to dodge the deadly smash attacks by golems.
        <p>
        <p>
            Defeating a boss monster gives valuable rewards like rare weapons or armor and lots of experience.
